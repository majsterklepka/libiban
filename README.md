# Project libiban
Smart library designed for test iban number

The libiban library was prepared to verify the IBAN bank account number. Verification is done by calculating the checksum. In order to carry out the verification, the library uses the operation of great precision on huge numbers. For this purpose, the gmp library is used.

Initially, the library was an integral part of the Bank Cash Deposit application, and this repository isolates this library from the BaCaDe project.
